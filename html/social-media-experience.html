                I've been working for Air Transat for 2 years and for the last year, I've been part of the Social Media team. When I started, we were a team of 4 people full-time and a few agents who helped on the side. Their main tasks being call center agents. For
                2 months now, we have a full team of 15 agents and a supervisor.

                        Our main task is obviously to speak to our passengers. We are in charge of answering all questions, concerns and complaints on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and more recently, Apple Business Chat. We are the only department who answer on behalf of other
                        departments. All other departments are specialized on one subject only. We can answer general questions, on our products, (

                        Since our department just officially started, we have a lot of new recruits to form. I've been tasked with giving the formation to all of our newest acquisitions. I have to show them the systems we use & how to work. Which department we can and can't
                        get in touch with when we have problems, as well as all of our procedures.
                        <p></p>
                        Since we used to be a 4 person team, our information and procedures were all over the place. For this reason, as part of my new responsibility, I will have to make a full procedure book with our team. This way, the information will be simple to find.

                        This comes with a great responsibility. We need to make sure our passengers feel like they are receiving the best service possible. Whether they are asking a simple general question, have lost an item on board or even when they want to file a complaint
                        because of something that happened during a flight or a vacation. We pride ourselves on our excellent customer service. It's part of our brand.
